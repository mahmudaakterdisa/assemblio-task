# Assemblio Task

This project is a text editing tool built with React and TypeScript. It provides an interactive and intuitive interface for users to edit text styles including font, color and size. Changes are immediately reflected on the screen and can also be exported to a JSON file for future use.

## Features

- Live text editing with a rich toolbar for changing styles
- Style changes can be exported to a JSON file
- Test coverage with Jest and React Testing Library

## Tech Stack

- React: For building the user interface
- TypeScript: For adding static types to JavaScript and enhancing code quality and understandability
- Jest & React Testing Library: For unit testing the components

## Considerations

- Code organization and quality: I aim to follow best practices and principles such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and component isolation for maintainability and scalability.
- Performance: I optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders and adjusting canvas update frequency. 
- Context API: I use the React Context API for state management to avoid prop drilling and to ensure that the state can be shared across the whole app.
- TypeScript: I use TypeScript for static typing, which can prevent potential runtime errors and enhance code quality and understandability.

## Installation
